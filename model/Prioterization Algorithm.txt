### **Emergency Vehicle Priority Algorithm**

1. **Start**

2. **Detect Emergency Vehicles**
   - If no emergency vehicles are detected, **Stop**.

3. **Prioritize Vehicles (if multiple emergency vehicles detected)**

4. **For each detected emergency vehicle:**
   - Check if the next traffic signal is green:
     - If green, allow the vehicle to proceed.
     - If not green, change the signal to green for the relevant lane for 10 seconds.
   - Adjust the traffic flow by continuing to the next signal.

5. **Repeat Step 4 for all emergency vehicles**

6. **Stop**
