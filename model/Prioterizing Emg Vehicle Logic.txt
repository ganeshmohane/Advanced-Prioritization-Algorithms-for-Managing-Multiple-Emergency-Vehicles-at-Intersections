Simple Algo : 
START
Using Model Detect Emergency Vehicles
        - If no emergency vehicles are detected,  STOP.
Prioritize Vehicles (if multiple emergency vehicles detected)**
For each detected emergency vehicle:
   - Check if the next traffic signal is green:
   - If green, allow the vehicle to proceed.
   - If not green, change the signal to green for the relevant lane for 10 secs.
   - Adjust the traffic flow by continuing to the next signal.
Repeat Step 4 for all emergency vehicles
STOP

### Adding Logic for whom to give priority

To prioritize multiple emergency vehicles, you can use a combination of the type of emergency vehicle and their current situation (e.g., distance to the intersection, next signal state). Here's how you can structure the prioritization process:

### **Priority Criteria**

1. **Type of Vehicle:**
   - Ambulance > Fire Truck > Police Car
   - This is the basic priority order based on the type of emergency.

2. **Distance to Intersection:**
   - Among vehicles of the same type, prioritize the one closest to the intersection.

3. **Signal State:**
   - If two vehicles of the same type are equidistant, check their respective lane's next signal state.
   - If one has a green signal, prioritize that vehicle.

4. **Severity (Optional):**
   - If available, prioritize based on the severity or urgency of the situation (e.g., critical patients in ambulances).

### **Step-by-Step Prioritization Process**

1. **Start**

2. **Detect Emergency Vehicles**
   - If no emergency vehicles are detected, **Stop**.

3. **If multiple emergency vehicles detected:**
   - **Sort by Vehicle Type**: Prioritize Ambulance > Fire Truck > Police Car.
   - **Within the Same Type:**
     - **Sort by Distance**: Prioritize the vehicle closest to the intersection.
     - **If Same Distance**:
       - **Check Signal State**: Prioritize the vehicle with the green signal in the next lane.

4. **For each detected emergency vehicle:**
   - **If next signal is green**, allow the vehicle to proceed.
   - **If next signal is not green**, change the signal to green for 10 seconds.
   - Adjust the traffic flow by continuing to the next signal.

5. **Repeat for all emergency vehicles**

6. **Stop**

### **Example Scenarios**

- **Scenario 1**: Two ambulances detected, one is 50 meters away, the other 100 meters. The 50-meter one gets priority.
- **Scenario 2**: Two fire trucks detected, both 70 meters away. One has a green signal in the next lane. That vehicle gets priority.
- **Scenario 3**: An ambulance, fire truck, and police car detected. The ambulance gets priority regardless of distance or signal.

This approach ensures that the most critical emergency vehicles get through first, and when there's a tie in type, the vehicle closest to the intersection or with a green signal in the next lane gets priority.
