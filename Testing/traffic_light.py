# How Traffic Light work is that it stays neutral between night 
# then continues from red to amber then green and then amber and whole loop continues


# Main issues with traditonal Traffic Lights - 
'''
Fixed timing: The timing for each light phase is often fixed, which can lead to inefficient traffic flow, especially during peak hours.
Limited adaptability: Traditional traffic lights are not able to adapt to changing traffic conditions in real time.
Inefficient resource allocation: The fixed timing of traditional traffic lights can result in inefficient allocation of resources, such as road space.
Susceptible to congestion: If traffic volume exceeds the capacity of the intersection, traditional traffic lights can become overwhelmed and lead to congestion.

# Points - 
# 1. Adjust Traffic Light Timing optimizing it where it requires most
# 2. Detecting Emergency Vehicles & Adjusting Traffic Lights 
# 3. Intelligent Pedestrian Crossing - Using Camera or Button input
# 4. if someone using Google Map they can see Ambulances
